# Texas Mortgage Issues Assessment

## Description
  Texas mortgages frequently had reported issues to a variety of banks between 2011 to 2019. We are focusing our project on the Texas customer mortgage complaints resulting in a variety of closed complaints. Our target audience are consumers looking at their options to choose a financial company in Texas.

## Motivation
  Our team’s motivation is consumer awareness about the companies with high trending issues in the state of Texas involved with mortgages. We plan to accomplish a dataset that presents the breakdown of various issues that were reported with which top companies that provide mortgage loans proving or disproving, public responses had any effect on the outcome of closed issues.

## Hypothesis
  Our hypothesis suggests the primary challenges associated with Texas mortgages that banks addressed, had more customer complaints that were effectively closed with public responses. 

## Null Hypothesis
  Our null hypothesis suggests the primary challenges associated with Texas mortgages that banks addressed, had little to no differences in the effect of public responses in customer complaints. 

## Research Questions to Answer
1. Do consumer complaints display a trend in company public responses?
   - What Issues were most frequent within Texas mortgages between 2011-2019?
   - Which top three companies had the most closed responses?
